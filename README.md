A Cura Plugin to send print information directly to [3D Print Log](https://www.3dprintlog.com). This will open a new browser tab with a New Print form pre-populated with information from Cura, allowing for easy transferring of print times, settings, and filament usage.

Requires the user to be logged into [3D Print Log](https://www.3dprintlog.com). If you do not have an account yet, create a FREE account today at [3D Print Log](https://www.3dprintlog.com).

## Installation

You can install this plugin via the Ultimaker Cura Marketplace. Alternatively, you can download the `.curapackage` from the Releases tab and drag/drop into Cura to install.

## Usage

Once installed, a prompt will be displayed asking if you would like to send the print information to 3D Print Log when you save GCode. Alternatively, you can send print information through the `Extensions -> 3D Print Log -> Send to 3D Print Log` menu option.

This will only prepopulate the form, no information is saved until you save the form in 3D Print Log.
